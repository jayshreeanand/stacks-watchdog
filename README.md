## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- MongoDB (optional, for full functionality)
- OpenAI API key (for AI-powered features)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stacks-watchdog-ai.git
   cd stacks-watchdog-ai
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   cd frontend && npm install && cd ..
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

4. Configure AI features:

   Add your OpenAI API key to the `.env` file:

   ```
   REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   REACT_APP_USE_MOCK_AI=false  # Set to true to use mock AI responses instead of real API
   ```

### Running the Application

#### With Mock Data (Default)

This mode uses mock data and doesn't require a connection to the Stacks blockchain:

```bash
./start-app.sh --mock
```

#### With Testnet Data

This mode connects to the Stacks Testnet and uses real blockchain data:

```bash
./start-app.sh --testnet
```

#### With Mainnet Data

This mode connects to the Stacks mainnet and uses real blockchain data:

```bash
./start-app.sh --mainnet
```

### Switching Data Sources in the UI

You can also switch between data sources directly in the UI:

1. Look for the "Data Source" dropdown in the top-right corner of the dashboard
2. Select your preferred data source:
   - Mock Data: Uses locally generated mock data
   - Stacks Testnet: Connects to the Stacks Testnet
   - Stacks Mainnet: Connects to the Stacks mainnet

Note: Switching data sources in the UI will reload the page to refresh the data.
